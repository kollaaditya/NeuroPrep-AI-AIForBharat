# NeuroPrep AI – System Requirements

## 1. Problem Statement

India’s competitive exam ecosystem is content-focused but strategy-blind.

Students prepare academically but fail due to:
- Cognitive fatigue
- Time mismanagement
- Panic-driven decision making
- Strategy inefficiency

Existing platforms focus on mock testing and content delivery but lack behavioral intelligence analysis.

There is a need for an AI-driven system that evaluates cognitive performance patterns and optimizes exam strategy.

## 2. Target Users

- JEE Aspirants
- NEET Aspirants
- GATE Aspirants
- Government Exam Candidates
- Placement Preparation Students
- Coaching Institutes (Phase 2)

---

## 3. Proposed Solution

NeuroPrep AI is an AI-powered Cognitive Intelligence Coach that:

- Analyzes behavioral patterns across mock tests
- Detects fatigue thresholds and stress impact
- Identifies strategic inefficiencies
- Generates adaptive simulation scenarios
- Predicts performance trajectory

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Cognitive Pattern Engine
- Track time distribution per difficulty
- Detect accuracy drift over exam duration
- Identify question-attempt sequencing patterns
- Estimate guess probability

### 4.2 Adaptive Simulation Engine
- Dynamic difficulty adjustment
- Time-pressure scenarios
- Realistic exam environment modeling

### 4.3 Cognitive Intelligence Scoring
- Focus Stability Index
- Stress Sensitivity Score
- Strategic Discipline Score

### 4.4 Strategy Optimization Module
- Section attempt recommendations
- Time allocation refinement
- Risk management suggestions

### 4.5 Forecasting Engine
- Predicted score range
- Improvement timeline
- Readiness probability

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

- Support 10,000+ concurrent users
- Sub-3 second AI response time
- Secure cloud infrastructure
- Responsible and explainable AI outputs
- Data privacy compliance

---

## 6. Why AI is Required

Traditional systems use static scoring models.

NeuroPrep AI requires LLM-based reasoning for:
- Sequential behavioral analysis
- Context-aware cognitive modeling
- Adaptive strategy generation
- Probabilistic performance forecasting

These capabilities cannot be implemented using rule-based logic alone.

## 7. Expected Impact

- Improved strategic performance
- Reduced stress-driven score loss
- Enhanced cognitive resilience
- Scalable across India’s exam ecosystem
