                                     NeuroPrep AI - System Requirements

1. Problem Statement

India has one of the largest competitive exam ecosystems (JEE, NEET, GATE, UPSC, campus placements). 
Students focus heavily on content preparation but lack cognitive performance optimization.

Current platforms such as BYJU'S, Unacademy, and PhysicsWallah focus on content delivery and mock testing, 
but they do not analyze behavioral patterns like cognitive fatigue, stress response, time mismanagement, 
or panic-driven errors.

There is a need for an AI-powered system that evaluates not just knowledge, 
but cognitive and strategic performance under exam conditions.



 2. Target Users

-> JEE Aspirants
-> NEET Aspirants
-> GATE Aspirants
-> Government Exam Aspirants
-> College Placement Candidates
-> Coaching Institutes (Future Expansion)


 3. Proposed Solution

NeuroPrep AI is an AI-powered Cognitive Intelligence Coach that:

-> Analyzes mock test performance
-> Detects cognitive fatigue patterns
-> Identifies stress-triggered performance drops
-> Optimizes exam strategy
-> Simulates high-pressure exam environments


4. Core Functional Requirements

  4.1 Cognitive Pattern Engine
      -> Analyze time per question
      -> Detect accuracy drop patterns
      -> Identify difficulty-level performance clusters
      -> Measure fatigue onset threshold

  4.2 Adaptive Exam Simulation
    -> Dynamically adjust question difficulty
    -> Introduce timed pressure conditions
    -> Simulate realistic exam environments

  4.3 Mental Resilience Scoring
    -> Generate Focus Stability Index
    -> Generate Stress Sensitivity Score
    -> Generate Strategic Discipline Rating

  4.4 AI Strategy Optimizer
    -> Recommend section attempt order
    -> Suggest time allocation improvements
    -> Identify high-risk guessing behavior

  4.5 Performance Forecast Engine
    -> Predict score range
    -> Estimate improvement timeline
    -> Provide readiness percentage


 5. Non-Functional Requirements

-> Scalable architecture (support 10,000+ users)
-> Secure data storage
-> Response latency under 3 seconds
-> Responsible AI usage
-> Data privacy compliance

6. Why AI is Required

This solution requires AI for:

-> Behavioral sequence pattern analysis
-> Cognitive performance modeling
-> Context-aware strategy recommendation
-> Adaptive simulation generation
-> Probabilistic forecasting

Rule-based systems cannot dynamically analyze cognitive behavior across sessions.


7. Expected Impact

-> Improved exam performance
-> Reduced stress-driven mistakes
-> Better time management
-> Increased exam confidence
-> Scalable use across India’s exam ecosystem
